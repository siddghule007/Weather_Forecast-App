   Enter city names in the EditText placed just below action bar. You can enter either 
   one city or multiple cities, each one separated by comma. Then press button next to it.
   If button shows cross(X) on it, it means you don't have mobile data or wi-fi with working 
   internet connection. Wait till it shows all the cities. But keep in mind you won't 
   get cities in same order as you entered because of parallel running threads. Then 
   click on the city name and you will see 14 days forecast for the city.

   First click on the action button at right top. Enable GPS if navigated to location settings. 
   You won't be navigated if gps is already enabled.  Wait till app collects your location 
   data and you will get forecast for your current location using GPS Enabled Weather Forecast APP.
